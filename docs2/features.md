This comprehensive list covers the breadth of Clubhouse's original features and recent additions, integrated with the specific spiritual focus of ChurchHouse. Prioritizing the "Core Social Audio Experience" and "User Profile & Social Engagement" sections will be key for the initial prototype, followed by the "Unique ChurchHouse Faith-Based Enhancements" to differentiate the app. The "Advanced Features & Monetization" are for future phases beyond the initial free prototype.

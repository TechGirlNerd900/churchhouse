# ChurchHouse Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing the features of the ChurchHouse app and replacing the existing placeholder files with actual implementation details. The implementation will be based on the provided documentation in `docs/`, `docs2/`, and `plan.md`.

## 1. Prioritize and Fix Existing Errors

The immediate priority is to fix the existing TypeScript errors, which are primarily "Cannot find module" errors. This will be done by:

1.  **Creating missing service files:** I will create the missing service files, such as `authService.ts`, `bibleService.ts`, `chapelService.ts`, `feedService.ts`, `notificationService.ts`, and `prayerService.ts`.
2.  **Implementing Redux slices:** I will then implement the Redux slices (`authSlice.ts`, `bibleSlice.ts`, `chapelSlice.ts`, `feedSlice.ts`, `notificationSlice.ts`, `prayerSlice.ts`) with the actual logic based on the feature descriptions in the documentation.

## 2. Follow the Development Plan

I will follow the development plan outlined in `docs2/guide.md` to implement the features in a structured manner. The development phases will be as follows:

1.  **Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic Structure:** This phase is already partially complete. I will ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and that the project structure aligns with the plan.
2.  **Phase 2: Authentication & Social Feed Foundation:** I will implement the authentication system using Firebase Authentication and build the foundation for the "Daily Scroll" social feed.
3.  **Phase 3: Bible Integration & Feed Enhancement:** I will integrate a Bible API and enhance the social feed with Bible-related features.
4.  **Phase 4: Core Room Features ("safespace"):** I will implement the core audio room features using Agora.io or Twilio.
5.  **Phase 5: Advanced Audio & Real-time Features:** I will add advanced audio features and real-time functionalities.
6.  **Phase 6: Fellowships & Social Features:** I will implement the "Fellowships" (Clubs) system and other social features.
7.  **Phase 7: Prayer & Faith Features:** I will build the "Prayer Altar" and other faith-based features.
8.  **Phase 8: Content Safety & Polish:** I will implement content safety features and add final UI polish.
9.  **Phase 9: Testing & Deployment:** I will conduct comprehensive testing and prepare the app for deployment.

## 3. No More Placeholders

I will no longer use placeholder files or comments. All new files will be created with the actual implementation details based on the provided documentation. I will also replace the existing placeholder files with their full implementations.

## 4. Next Steps

 Of course. Here is the execution plan:

   1. Finish Creating Service Files: I will create the last remaining service file, prayerService.ts, to manage prayer requests. This
      will complete the first step of resolving the "Cannot find module" errors.

   2. Implement Redux Slices: I will then create and implement the Redux Toolkit slices. This is the second part of fixing the
      initial errors. I will create the following files with basic Redux boilerplate and async thunks for interacting with the
      services:
       * authSlice.ts
       * bibleSlice.ts
       * chapelSlice.ts
       * feedSlice.ts
       * notificationSlice.ts
       * prayerSlice.ts

   3. Update Redux Store: I will update the main Redux store in app/src/store/index.ts to include all the new slice reducers.

  Completing these steps will resolve all the initial "Cannot find module" errors and establish the core data flow for the
  application, paving the way for UI development.

  Shall I proceed with this plan?Okay, I will now create prayerService.ts in app/src/services/. This service will manage prayer
  requests using Firestore.

 ///  ooking at the provided code and documentation, I can see this is a React Native app called ChurchHouse - a faith-based social platform similar to Clubhouse. Let me analyze the current state and suggest improvements.

Current State Analysis
Based on the files shown, you have:

Service Layer: 
feedService.ts
 and 
prayerService.ts
 are implemented with basic Firebase operations
Documentation: Comprehensive feature specifications and implementation plans
Project Structure: Well-organized React Native app with navigation, screens, and services
Key Observations & Improvements
1. Service Layer Enhancements
The current services are basic but functional. Here are improvements:

Type Safety Issues:

Both services lack TypeScript types for parameters
Return types should be more specific
Error handling could be more robust
Missing Features from Documentation:

No user filtering in getPosts() (should support following feed vs discovery feed)
Missing like/comment/share functionality
No hashtag or mention parsing
No audience control (public/followers/fellowship)
2. Data Structure Alignment
The services don't fully match the comprehensive data structure outlined in 
feed.md
:

Missing Fields in Posts:

userName, userProfilePic
imageUrl, videoUrl
bibleVerse object
links array for link previews
hashtags, mentions arrays
audience control
Engagement counts (likeCount, commentCount, shareCount)
3. Recommended Next Steps
Based on your 
implementation_plan.md
, you should:

Complete the Redux Implementation - Create the missing slice files mentioned in the plan
Enhance Service Types - Add proper TypeScript interfaces
Implement Missing Service Methods - Add like, comment, share functionality
Add Bible Integration - The documentation shows extensive Bible features planned
Implement Feed Filtering - Support for following vs discovery feeds
4. Specific Improvements Needed
For 
feedService.ts
:

Add user-specific feed filtering
Implement engagement methods (like, comment, share)
Add hashtag/mention parsing
Support for rich content (images, Bible verses)
For 
prayerService.ts
:

Add prayer response/support functionality
Implement privacy controls
Add prayer categories/tags
5. Architecture Suggestions
Looking at your 
implementation_plan.md
, you have a solid architecture planned. The current services should be expanded to match the comprehensive structure outlined, particularly:

Separate interaction services for likes/comments
Hashtag parsing utilities
Bible verse integration services
Content moderation hooks
Would you like me to help implement any of these specific improvements, such as enhancing the service types, adding the missing Redux slices, or implementing the engagement functionality?

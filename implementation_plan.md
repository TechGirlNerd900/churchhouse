# ChurchHouse Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing the features of the ChurchHouse app and replacing the existing placeholder files with actual implementation details. The implementation will be based on the provided documentation in `docs/`, `docs2/`, and `plan.md`.

## 1. Prioritize and Fix Existing Errors

The immediate priority is to fix the existing TypeScript errors, which are primarily "Cannot find module" errors. This will be done by:

1.  **Creating missing service files:** I will create the missing service files, such as `authService.ts`, `bibleService.ts`, `chapelService.ts`, `feedService.ts`, `notificationService.ts`, and `prayerService.ts`.
2.  **Implementing Redux slices:** I will then implement the Redux slices (`authSlice.ts`, `bibleSlice.ts`, `chapelSlice.ts`, `feedSlice.ts`, `notificationSlice.ts`, `prayerSlice.ts`) with the actual logic based on the feature descriptions in the documentation.

## 2. Follow the Development Plan

I will follow the development plan outlined in `docs2/guide.md` to implement the features in a structured manner. The development phases will be as follows:

1.  **Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic Structure:** This phase is already partially complete. I will ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and that the project structure aligns with the plan.
2.  **Phase 2: Authentication & Social Feed Foundation:** I will implement the authentication system using Firebase Authentication and build the foundation for the "Daily Scroll" social feed.
3.  **Phase 3: Bible Integration & Feed Enhancement:** I will integrate a Bible API and enhance the social feed with Bible-related features.
4.  **Phase 4: Core Room Features ("safespace"):** I will implement the core audio room features using Agora.io or Twilio.
5.  **Phase 5: Advanced Audio & Real-time Features:** I will add advanced audio features and real-time functionalities.
6.  **Phase 6: Fellowships & Social Features:** I will implement the "Fellowships" (Clubs) system and other social features.
7.  **Phase 7: Prayer & Faith Features:** I will build the "Prayer Altar" and other faith-based features.
8.  **Phase 8: Content Safety & Polish:** I will implement content safety features and add final UI polish.
9.  **Phase 9: Testing & Deployment:** I will conduct comprehensive testing and prepare the app for deployment.

## 3. No More Placeholders

I will no longer use placeholder files or comments. All new files will be created with the actual implementation details based on the provided documentation. I will also replace the existing placeholder files with their full implementations.

## 4. Next Steps

My immediate next step is to create the missing service files, starting with `authService.ts`.
